    /*Data Types and Variables -- JAVA SCRIPT provides seven different data types:
    undefined-- sth that hasnt been defined
    null-- means nothing
    boolean-- true or false
    string-- you know that
    symbol--immutable primitive value that is unique (we'll discuss that later)
    number-- a number

    //There are three ways to declare a variable in javascript
    //'var' is one of them
    // to declare a variable one way is to use the 'var' keyword which stands for variable


    var myName = "Beau" //later you can set it to something else without using the 'var' keyword.

    myName= 8 

    //Another way to declare variable in java script is using 'let' keyword
    let ourName= "freeCodeCamp"

    //Another way to declare a variable is using const
    const pi= 3.14

    /*Now note that the three ways of declaring variables are :
    var
    let 
        and
    const

    However, there are differences between them*/

    // differencxes between var, let and const
    
    //'var' is going to be able to be used throughout your whole program
    //'let' will only be used within the scope of where you declared that (we'll be talking about that and const in later years)
    //const is a variable that should never change, it can never change.
    //for example, the above variable 'myName' started out as 'beau' and was changed to 8, because its a 'var', 'const' doesnt operate that way, it doesnt change.
    //if you do try to change it, it gives an error.



    //4
    //Storing Values with Assignment Operator
    //There is a difference between declaring variables and assigning variables
    var a; //assigning variables
    var b = 2; //assigning variables (declaring and assigning in one line)
    //you must end all lines with a semi colon in javascript;

    /*It's not actually required, you can actually just skipped the semi colon,
     but most people recommend that you put the semi colon to indicate where the end of the line is.*/

    var b = 2; /* The equal sign (=) is the assignment operator
               It means that 2 is assigned to b, and NOT that 2 is equal to b. */

    //another assignment
    a = 7; //did not have to declare 'a' because a has already been declared above
    b = a; // This means that you have assigned the content of 'a' to 'b'

    //Remember that console.log() allows you to see things in te console. 
    //console.log(a) and then load it to see it in the console
    console.log(a)
