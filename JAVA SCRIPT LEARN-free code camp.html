    /*Data Types and Variables -- JAVA SCRIPT provides seven different data types:
    undefined-- sth that hasnt been defined
    null-- means nothing
    boolean-- true or false
    string-- you know that
    symbol--immutable primitive value that is unique (we'll discuss that later)
    number-- a number
           and
    object-- can store a lot of different key value pairs (we'll discuss that later)

    //There are three ways to declare a variable in javascript
    //'var' is one of them
    // to declare a variable one way is to use the 'var' keyword which stands for variable


    var myName = "Beau" //later you can set it to something else without using the 'var' keyword.

    myName= 8 

    //Another way to declare variable in java script is using 'let' keyword
    let ourName= "freeCodeCamp"

    //Another way to declare a variable is using const
    const pi= 3.14

    /*Now note that the three ways of declaring variables are :
    var
    let 
        and
    const

    However, there are differences between them*/

    // differencxes between var, let and const
    
    //'var' is going to be able to be used throughout your whole program
    //'let' will only be used within the scope of where you declared that (we'll be talking about that and const in later years)
    //const is a variable that should never change, it can never change.
    //for example, the above variable 'myName' started out as 'beau' and was changed to 8, because its a 'var', 'const' doesnt operate that way, it doesnt change.
    //if you do try to change it, it gives an error.



    //4
    //Storing Values with Assignment Operator
    //There is a difference between declaring variables and assigning variables
    var a; //assigning variables
    var b = 2; //assigning variables (declaring and assigning in one line)
    //you must end all lines with a semi colon in javascript;

    /*It's not actually required, you can actually just skipped the semi colon,
     but most people recommend that you put the semi colon to indicate where the end of the line is.*/

    var b = 2; /* The equal sign (=) is the assignment operator
               It means that 2 is assigned to b, and NOT that 2 is equal to b. */

    //another assignment
    a = 7; //did not have to declare 'a' because a has already been declared above
    b = a; // This means that you have assigned the content of 'a' to 'b'

    //Remember that console.log() allows you to see things in te console. 
    //console.log(b) and then load it to see it in the console
    console.log(b) //run it (You will see that 'b' automatically becomes the conetent of 'a' which is 7



    
    //You can use console.log() at different points of your javascript file.
    // to check the value of the variable.


    //5
    // Initializing Variables w/ Assignment Operator

    var a = 9;//recall that var a simply means declaring it
              // The equal 9 (= 9) then means initialising it with the assignment operator which is =
    
    //6
    //Uninitialized variables

    // before we do anything to variables, they are uninitialized (which means the value is undefined or not been set to anything). see below:
    var a; //uninitialized/undefined
    var b; //    "         "
    var c; //    "         "

    // To initialize the above three variables:
    var a = 5;
    var b = 10
    var c = "I am a" // a string variable (you can use var or string as data type)

    a = a + 1;
    b = b + 5;
    c = c + "String! ";
    console.log(c);

    //7
    // Case Sensitivity in Variables
    // Variable names in java script are case sensitive, this means that capoitalization matters
    // Note that the declarations and the assignments have different variables and so, will raise an error

    //Declarations
    var StUdLyCapVaR;
    var properCamelCase;
    var TitleCaseOver;

    //Assignments
    /*It brings an error as the variable declared is different from that used for assignment. 
    Even though the letters are the same, the capitalization is different. Therefore, variables used for assignment are not defined (error)*/
    StUDLYCAPVAR = 10; 
    PRoperCAmelCAse = "A String"; 
    tiTLEcASEoVER = 9000;      

    // Solution to the above: Use camelCase style of declaring variables (see below: )
    var studlyCapVar;
    var properCamelCase;
    var titleCaseOver;

    studlyCapVar = 10;
    properCamelCase = "A String";
    titleCaseOver = 9000;

    //8
    //Adding Numbers

    //its very straightforward to add numbers, just add the numbers normally during assignment. See example below:
    var sum= 10 + 10;
    console.log(sum); // the result is 20 in the console

    //9
    //Subtracting Numbers

    var difference= 30 - 20;
    console.log(difference);

    //10
    //Multiplying Numbers
    var product= 7 * 4;
    console.log(product);

    //11
    //Dividing Numbers
    var quotient= 28 / 7;
    console.log(quotient);

    //12
    //Incrementing Numbers
    var myVar = 8;
    myVar= myVar + 1; // incrementing simply means adding 1 to the number
    console.log(myVar);

    // There is a quicker way to increment a number and that is the use of ++
    var myVarPlus= 8;
    myVarPlus= myVarPlus ++; //this is wrong as there should be no space between the variable and the ++
    myVarPlus= myVarPlus++; //This is wrong..................
    console.log(myVarPlus);
